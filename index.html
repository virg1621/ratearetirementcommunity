<h2>What is "Rate A CCRC"?</h2>

	<p>At present, there are no rating sites for Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs);
	 consumers who want to understand more about the financial stability of a potential 
	 community have nowhere to turn for help.</p> 

	<p>We’re going to change that.  By partnering with state regulatory agencies, Rate a 
	Retirement Community will give consumers free access to simple, easy to understand CCRC 
	ratings.</p>
	
	<p>Here are some sample CCRC ratings:</p>

	<img src="bad_community.jpg" alt="Bad Community"><br>

<h2>What’s in it for the state CCRC agency?</h2>

	<p>Right now, our platform allows state regulators to do the following:</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Provide better information for CCRC consumers:</span> 
	By incentivizing CCRCs in your state to use our service, you help consumers make the 
	right choices about their move to senior housing.</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Track CCRC financial performance over time:</span> 
	Our multi-year financial displays show year-over-year financial data, 
	allowing greater depth in annual audits or ongoing oversight.<p>

	<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Flag CCRCs that are at risk!</span> In the past, 
	financial information has been compiled using paper copies of records.  Now you can
	 automatically review hundreds of records and check for communities that have risky 
	 financial situations.</p>

		<li>Manage communities and approval processes online</li>
		<li>Compare projected versus actual financial performance for start-up CCRCs</li>
